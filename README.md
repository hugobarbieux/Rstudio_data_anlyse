# Rstudio_data_anlyse
I have created this public repo where anyone can find data and analyses I have used to produce "The Vanishing Care Workers Story".
You will find the report via https://hugobarbieux.github.io/homecareworkers/?fbclid=IwAR3W2G-A5TQDKCAGGWllBTDMc82uh-aUJJx3IcOnbW6PbZf4X3tTcNjDiwg
You can have a look to my calculations and analyses and check what data have been used.
You will also find my twitter account at the bottom of the story.
Feel free to contact me if you have amendements or changes to make.
You can also contact me if you have further data to improve the story.
